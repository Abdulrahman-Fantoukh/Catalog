## introduction

This is Abdulrahman Fantoukh submission for Udacity Item catalog project

I used python version 3.7 in this project and the flask and sql alchemy frameworks

## code design
the code contains every things that mentioned in the requirement and i added a function for adding directly to the category (this happen when the user in a category page)

## Notes
if there was any problem with google sign in functionality try to sign in with other Gmail account.
I say this because i tried 3 different Gmails and one of them for an unknown reason didn't work.

## References

* i reused some of the instructor's code 
for gconnect,gdisconnect ,createUser, getUserInfo and getUserID functions
